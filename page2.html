                        <p class="item-text display-7">Nu School was a dual internship/business education platform pitched by Daniel Ahmadizadeh, the CEO of the Y Combinator backed marketing company PersistIQ. According to Daniel, Nu School is for students who had their internships cancelled because of COVID-19 to develop startup ideas, create a minumum viable product in teams, learn to give a successful pitch, and attend conferences held by his friends and colleagues from the Y Combinator.<br><br> As part of the innagural class of Nu School, I recieved the title of 'Technology Fellow' where I would use my technology expertise to not only get hands-on in the software side of minimum viable product develeopment, but also reach out to address technical issues, concerns, and comments on how to improve Nu School for upcoming years.</p>

                        <p class="item-text display-7">Wright is the ed-tech startup concept I pitched to my peers and Y Combinator backed entrepreneurs at the end of Nu School 2020. I worked on developing the concept with two other Nu School Fellows, Elizabeth Chen, an Anthropology student in City College of New York, and Dirghayu Kaushik, an Engineering student from the Indian Institute of Technology.&nbsp;<br><br>The concept of Wright is one in which users are provided with weekly topics based on current events. Users can then write in favor or against the current events, while others can thumbs up or thumbs down writing pieces based on how well they back up the arguments. Wright serves to both improve people’s writing skills through community peer reviews, as well as help people see other perspectives in a controlled, calm enviroment.<br><br>To show Wright in action, I used Adobe XD to create a minimum viable product of how the website would look and function. I also used Google forms to help Dirghayu and Elizabeth conduct market research amongst college students (our target market) on school subreddits to see how different majors feel about potentially using a platform that can help them become better writers.</p>
