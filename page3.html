To create the most efficient MVP possible, I thought it would be best to create UX mockups and wireframe for how Wright's website would work. Through online research I came across a software called Adobe Xd, the most popular tool for UX and wireframe creation.<br><br>With my background in computer science and eagerness to learn new technology skills, I committed to self-learning Adobe Xd on my own, though extensive research. This way my teammates could focus in on the strengths they can bring to Wright’s development.<br><br>While self-learning a brand development software, mere weeks before pitch day seemed daunting, I knew that as an entrepreneur it’s crucial to step up to face challenges for the sake of both your team and company.<br><br>Through extensive readings of Xd documentation and reaching out online to UX professionals in the industry for help, I had multiple mockups and wireframes ready. I showcased the initial designs to the Wright team to get their input. Eventually we settled on a sleek, minimalistic look. A look that was praised by the rest of the Nu School fellows, and sponsoring entrepreneur</p><p></p>

Seeing firsthand how they were aiding in the process of developing brand new products, many of them aimed at solving social issues like Wright further ignited my passion for entrepreneurship.<br> <br>At the end of August, mere weeks after Wright's Nu School pitch, I connected with Dr. Tracy Flood, a medical researcher, and entrepreneur. Dr. Flood was in the process of developing a startup known as Broadstreet, a data analysis company that creates free-to-use infographics detailing COVID-19 trends in different communities across the United States. Broadstreet was looking for UX Design Interns to join their team. After hearing about the hard work Broadstreet was doing in aiding people's understanding of the pandemic, I was eager to join the startup. I applied for the UX Design Internship and shared my resume and portfolio with Dr. Flood and was promptly hired!<br><br>Currently, I'm working with a team to use Adobe Xd to develop a prototype of how Broadstreet's new website should look to better showcase current projects the Broadstreet team is working on.&nbsp;<br></p>
