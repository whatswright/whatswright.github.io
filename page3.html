                                <p class="mbr-content-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"></p><p>During Nu School's Product Development conference, we were advised to have a minimum viable product (MVP) to demo for our pitch. We were encouraged to think on our own on how to create an MVP, and to not be afraid of getting out of our comfort zones to develop one. For Wright's MVP, I reached out to my team and told them of my idea to create UX mockups and a wireframe for how Wright's website would work. There was only one problem however: none of us knew anything about UX development. so whoever leads the UX development task would have to be completely self-taught before pitch day. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Given that it was my idea, and that I was the only one in the team with an educational background in computer science, I took it upon myself to learn how to develop UX mockups and wireframes. As an entrepreneur itâ€™s crucial to step up to face challenges for the sake of both your team and company. This was taught to us by the Leadership conference Nu School assigned us to attend. I was happy to take on this challenge, not only because it would benefit the team, but because it's what a true entrepreneur would do. By taking on the task of UX mockups and wireframes, my team were then able to focus on their strengths to lead us closer to finishing preparation for our pitch.<br><br>After countless Reddit discussions, YouTube playlists, and Googling, I discovered learned that Adobe Xd was a viable software to use. I showcased some initial designs to the Wright team to get their input, and eventually we all settled on a sleek, minimalistic look. A look that was praised by the rest of the Nu School fellows, and sponsoring entrepreneurs.</p><p></p>

The project I volunteered for gave me an oppurtunity to look at the importance of creativity in the tech industry. The color scheme, functionality, and aesthetic were all things I got to toy with.</p><p>After Nu School 2020 had ended, I knew I wanted to pick up UX development as a hobby, both to further improve Wright as well as to strengthen my skillset for future entrepreneurship ventures. My newfound passion led me to developing UX mockups and a wirefram for a new concept: letsshoot.com, a networking website for artists and clients alike.</p><p>I also decided to enroll in, and am in the process of finishing, Udacity's "Human-Computer Interaction program during. A free, non-certificate 16-week course that detailed design principles, the relationship between cognitive science and UX, and how UX best practices can improve healthcare, education, other industries.</p><p></p>

                                        My developing love for UX as a hobby led me to network with multiple UX professionals on LinkedIn. Seeing firsthand how they were aiding in the process of developing brand new products, many of them aimed at solving social issues like Wright, further ignited my passion for entrepreneuship.&nbsp;<br><br>At the end of August, mere weeks after Wright's Nu School pitch, I connected with Dr. Tracy Flood, a medical researcher and entrepreneur. Dr. Flood was in the process of developing a startup known as Broadstreed, a data analysis company that creates free-to-use infographics detailing COVID-19 trends in different communities across the United States. Broadstreet was looking for UX Design Interns to join their team. After hearing about the hard work Broadstreet was doing in aiding people's understanding of the pandemic, I was eager to join the startup. I applied for the UX Design Internship and shared my resume and portfolio with Dr. Flood and was promptly hired!<br><br>Currently, I'm working with a team to use Adobe Xd to develop a prototype of how Broadstreet's new website should look to better showcase current projects the Broadstreet team is working on.&nbsp;<br></p>

                                        Getting the chance to learn Adobe Xd to further my own entrepreneurship venture with Wright, and getting to use these skills to help contribute to a new startup like Broadstreet has given me the oppurunity to pursue entreprenurial ventures that I otherwise may not have been possible.
