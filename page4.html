The conferences detailed the multiple aspects that should be considered when it comes to developing a startup. These conferences aided in the development in Wright. Below are just a few of the conferences that stood out the most to me.</h3>

In this conference, Nu School Fellows had the oppurunity to witness firsthand some of the many ways to create a minimum viable product (MVP) of their own to demonstrate during their pitches at the end of Nu School 2020. <br><br>According to Luciano, our MVP shouldn't just solely focus on functionality. Design, usability, and reliability must also be considered, instead of just solely focusing on how our prototype functions during our pitch. After the conference, I had a better grasp of what's needed to make an MVP efficient, not just for Wright but for future endeavors as well.<br></p>

                            <p class="mbr-step-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">&nbsp;Taught by Helson Taveras, the Founder of General Computing, Coding 101 was a conference that detailed the best programming languages for specific tasks. Programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, and SQL were discussed for data analysis, website development, and database management respectively. Helson also guided us towards free resources to keep in mind when using programming to create products for a startup. <br><br>Wright was being pitched as a web application. Through this conference, I was able to get a grasp on how JavaScript would be a useful asset to know for creating a fully functioning website if Wright were to launch fully, post-Nu School. Coding 101 showed me that learning, especially for entrepreneurs, is a never-ending process. For a programmer, it’s never enough to just know one programming language since languages serve unique functions. As an entrepreneur, it’s important to always keep your skillset growing and diverse to continue to add meaningful contributions to the product’s future.</p>

                            <p class="mbr-step-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Mental Health 101 was held by Bea Arthur, a licensed mental health counselor and CEO of Difference. Bea's conference emphasized the importance of caring for your mental health when running a startup. Topics covered were managing others, bouncing back emotionally when falling behind schedule on a project, and getting over a disastrous pitch.<br><br>Pitching a startup concept within a few weeks, with a team of people from around the world is tough. Especially when factors such as technical hurdles, self-learning new skills, language barriers, and time-zone differences occur. Because of this, it was easy at times to feel stressed. However, through the conference, I was able to learn how to overcome the stresses of entrepreneurship by clearly delegating tasks amongst team members, understanding that the speed of progress can fluctuate, and knowing when to find time to relax. After Mental Health 101, I’ve gained the ability to give projects, both personal and entrepreneurial, my 100% without becoming overstressed.<br><br><br><br></p>
